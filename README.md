# FPGA_PACMAN
A FPGA-based Pac-Man implementation with a MicroBlaze soft processor, GPIO peripherals for keyboard input, and BRAM for graphical storage. The game is designed using a maze constructed of 8x8 tiles, custom FontROM graphics, and real-time movement logic.

Features Included:
* Keyboard Input via USB (MAX3241E): Controls Pac-Manâ€™s movement.
* Ghost AI: Three ghosts with unique movement patterns that chase Pac-Man.
* Power Pellets: Temporarily enable Pac-Man to eat ghosts.
* Score & Collision System: Tracks pellet consumption, ghost interactions, and win/loss conditions.
* Custom VGA Display: Rendered using a BRAM-based background and sprite animations.

Built as a final project for ECE 385 at UIUC, integrating hardware-accelerated game logic with efficient memory management.
